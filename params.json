{"name":"Snapper","body":"> Thanks to Snapper, you can mess up system configuration changes or package installations or updates without having to restore from an old backup and risking to lose some files. Just revert to the snapshot before your problematic change and youâ€™re fine.

Apart from the obvious creation and deletion of snapshots it can compare snapshots and revert differences between snapshots. In simple terms, this allows users to view older versions of files and revert changes. Snapper is available as a command line interface tool and a YaST module. Both make use of the C++ library libsnapper which is also available to other programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Travel back in time and see exact configuration changes on your Linux server","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
