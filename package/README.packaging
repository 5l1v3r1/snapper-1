This package should use just the content of the git tree. If you need
to make changes, make them in git and update the package from git
(you can send merge request if you don't have write access).

The online repository is at:
http://github.com/openSUSE/snapper

For building the package from git run the service directly:
osc service disabledrun

Note that snapper.spec and snapper.changes are part of the git
repo.
