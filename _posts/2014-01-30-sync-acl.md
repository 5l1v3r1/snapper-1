Snapper can now sync the users and groups from the ALLOW_USERS and
ALLOW_GROUPS settings to the ACL of the .snapshots directory, thus ensuring
the required permissions as described in
[snapper](/manpages/snapper.html#permissions).

Suppose you have already the config "home_tux" for the home directory of the
user "tux". All you need is to enable syncing of the ACL and allow the user
"tux" to work with the config:

<!-- using ``` looks ok locally but bad on github (newline after <code> -->

<pre><code>snapper -c home_tux set-config SYNC_ACL=yes ALLOW_USERS=tux
</code></pre>

Snapper has now added "tux" to the ACL:

<pre><code>getfacl -p /home/tux/.snapshots
# file: /home/tux/.snapshots
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
user:tux:r-x
group::r-x
mask::r-x
other::---
</code></pre>

This feature is available in snapper since version 0.2.0.
