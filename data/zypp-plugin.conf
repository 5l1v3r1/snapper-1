  <!--
       List of solvables. If the zypp commit transaction includes any solvable
       listed below, snapper will create pre and post snapshots.

       Shell-style wildcards, match="w"
           Must cover the whole solvable name: the pattern "systemd*" matches
           systemd-devel, but "systemd" does not.

       Regular Expressions, match="re"
           POSIX Extended Regular Expression Syntax (man 7 regex).
           They are automatically anchored at the beginning but not at the
           end, so "dracut" matches dracut-tools but not plymouth-dracut.

       If any of the matching solvables is marked as important, the snapshots
       are also marked as important.
