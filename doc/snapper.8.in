.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Snapper is a command\-line program for btrfs snapshot management. It can
create, delete and compare snapshots and rollback changes between snapshots.

.SH CONCEPTS

.SS Configurations
.LP
For each btrfs subvolume that should be snapshotted by snapper a configuration
file is required. The complete setup can be done with the create-config
command.

.SS Snapshots
.LP
Snapper distinguishes three types of snapshots.
.LP
\fBpre\fR - Pre snapshots should always have a corresponding post
snapshot. The intention of pre/post pairs is to snapshot the filesystem before
and after a change.
.LP
\fBpost\fR - See pre type.
.LP
\fBsingle\fR - These snapshots have no special relationship to other
snapshots.
.LP
Note that btrfs\-wise all three types are the same.

.SS Automatic Snapshot Creation
Next to manual snapshot creation snapshots are also created automatically.
.LP
\fBcron\-job\fR - A cron\-job creates hourly snapshots.
.LP
\fBcertain programs\fR - Certain programs like YaST and zypper create pre and
post snapshots before and after they modify the system.

.SS Cleanup Algorithms
.LP
Snapper provides several algorithms to cleanup old snapshots. The algorithms
are executed in a daily cron\-job. This can be configured in the corresponding
configurations files along with parameters for every algorithm.
.LP
\fBnumber\fR - Deletes the oldest snapshots when a certain number limit it
reached.
.LP
\fBtimeline\fR - Deletes old snapshots but keeps a number of hourly, daily,
monthly and yearly snapshots.
.LP
\fBempty\-pre\-post\fR - Deletes pre/post pairs with empty diffs.

.SH "GLOBAL OPTIONS"

.TP
.I \-q, \-\-quiet
Suppress normal output. Brief (esp. result notification) messages and error
messages will still be printed, though. If used together with conflicting
--verbose option, the --verbose option takes preference.
.TP
.I \-v, \-\-verbose
Increase verbosity. For debugging output specify this option twice.
.TP
.I \-t, \-\-table\-style
Specifies table style to use. Table style is identified by an integer number. TODO
.TP
.I \-c, \-\-config <name>
Use specified config file instead of the default files.
Other command line options specified together with --config and having
their counterpart in the config file are still prefered.
.TP
.I \-\-version
Print version and exit.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.LP
snapper provides a number of \fBcommands\fR. Each command accepts the options
listed in the GLOBAL OPTIONS section. These options must be specified
\fIbefore\fR the command name. In addition, many commands have specific
options, which are listed in this section. These command-specific options must
be specified \fIafter\fR the name of the command and \fIbefore\fR any of the
command arguments.

.TP
.B help
Shows short help texts.

.TP
.B list-configs
Lists available configurations.

.TP
.B create-config [options] <subvolume>
Creates a new configuration for a subvolume.
.TP
\fI\-t, \-\-template\fR <name>
Name of template for the new configuration file.

.TP
.B list [options]
Lists snapshots.
.TP
\fI\-t, \-\-type\fR <type>
Selects type of snapshots to list. Possible values are all, single and pre-post.

.TP
.B create [options]
Creates a new snapshot.
.TP
\fI\-t, \-\-type\fR <type>
Specifies the type of the new snapshot. Possible values are single, pre and post.
.TP
\fI\-\-pre\-number\fR <number>

.TP
\fI\-f, \-\-file\fR <file>
Read the files to rollback from the file <file>.

.TP
.B cleanup <cleanup-algorithm>

algorithms are number, timeline and empty-pre-post.
