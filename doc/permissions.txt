Non-root users can be allowed to use a config by setting ALLOW_USERS or
ALLOW_GROUPS in the config file. For all operations to work the user must also
be able to read and access the .snapshots directory.

The .snapshots directory must have owner and group root. The directory must
not be writable by anybody else.

Example: You have a config tux for /home/tux. To allow the user tux full
access set ALLOW_USERS="tux" in /etc/snapper/configs/tux and chmod a+rx
/home/tux/.snapshots.
